"""
    Test script for Q-factor fitting (pure Python version using numpy)
    ==================================================================

      Description
      -----------

         This software is from:
         "Q-factor Measurement by using a Vector Network Analyser",
         A. P. Gregory, National Physical Laboratory Report MAT 58 (2021)

         Fits FL and QL to reflection (S11) data by using the NLQFIT7 algorithm.

         Requires script qfitmod7.py
         Test data is read from file Table6c27.txt (as used in Figure 16 and
         Table 6(c) of MAT 58).

         Tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.8
